VGG-16 model that can identity an image, classifying it into a building or a forest. 
More testing is highly advisable, as the accuracy is around %, despite being trained with approximately 6,000 images in total. 
Project based on the work of AarohiSingla that you can find here: https://github.com/AarohiSingla/VGG-16.git
